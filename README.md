# emergency-response-system-gsm-gps
A prototype IoT system using GSM and GPS for real time emergency response. The goal was to create a low-cost, hardware-driven solution that could transmit a user’s location during a crisis.

## Hardware Setup
- **GPS module** for live location data  
- **GSM module** for message transmission  
- Powered through Arduino microcontroller  
- Breadboard + jumper wire assembly for fast iteration 

## My Contribution
I focused on **hardware integration and reliability**:
- Connecting and syncing GSM + GPS modules  
- Debugging inconsistent signals and power drops  
- Iteratively testing module responses under different conditions  
- Ensuring alerts could be sent with minimal latency  

## Technical Challenges
- **Signal reliability** → modules often dropped connection during testing  
- **Limited hardware resources** → worked with basic low-cost components  
- **Real-time performance** → system needed fast response in emergencies  

## Solutions Applied
- Rewired modules + stabilized power connections  
- Simplified the test logic for faster communication  
- Conducted repeated field tests to refine responsiveness  
- Logged and adjusted results until performance was stable  

## Outcome
- Functional prototype achieved  
- Demonstrated feasibility of using **GSM + GPS for emergency alerts**  
- Provided practical experience that informs my current medtech work on **Neurostep**
